## üìù Image Guidelines

### **Recommended Formats:**

- **Photos**: JPG/JPEG for photographs
- **Graphics/Diagrams**: PNG for graphics with transparency
- **Screenshots**: PNG for crisp UI elements

### **Recommended Sizes:**

- **Profile pictures**: 500x500px (square, high quality)
- **Project main images**: 800x600px or 1200x900px
- **Additional project images**: 600x400px minimum

### **Naming Convention:**

- Use descriptive names: `rover-can-system.jpg` instead of `IMG_001.jpg`
- Use hyphens for spaces: `circuit-diagram.jpg`
- Keep names lowercase for consistency

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Replace placeholder images** by adding your actual photos to the appropriate directories
2. **Update file names** in the HTML if needed (currently set to `main-image.jpg` for each project)
3. **Add multiple images per project** for detailed showcase galleries
4. **Compress images** for web optimization while maintaining quality
